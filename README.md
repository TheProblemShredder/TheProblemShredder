# TheProblemShredder (Ben Vivian)

I build **verification-first** research/tooling systems: preregistered thresholds, negative controls, ablations, deterministic run IDs, append-only audit ledgers, and CI that reproduces outputs.

## Pinned projects (run in minutes)

1) **ScrollCert vΩ — Public Demo**  
Verification scaffold: preregistration, negative controls, ablation discipline, blinded arms + reveal, deterministic IDs, append-only ledger, CI reproducibility.  
https://github.com/TheProblemShredder/ScrollCert_vOmega_PublicDemo

2) **ML Eval Harness vΩ — Public Demo**  
Generalized eval harness: baseline vs ablation vs negative control, blinded labels + reveal, deterministic IDs (AEQ/CID), append-only ledger, CI artifact checks.  
https://github.com/TheProblemShredder/ML_Eval_Harness_vOmega

3) **Quant Backtest Harness vΩ — Public Demo**  
Reproducible backtest harness: prereg params, baseline vs ablation delta gate, deterministic negative control, deterministic IDs, append-only ledger, artifact manifest, CI.

## What I’m building next (planned)

- **CLI Tooling vΩ** — packaging, configs, structured logs, tests

## What I’m looking for

Remote roles where reproducibility and evaluation discipline matter:
- Research Engineer / Evals Engineer
- Experiment platform / tooling
- Systems / automation
- Quant tooling
