# Ben Vivian (TheProblemShredder)

I build **verification-first** research & engineering systems: preregistration → controls → ablations → blinding → audit ledger.

## Featured work
- **ScrollCert vΩ (Public Demo)** — reproducible verification scaffold with CI

## What I’m looking for
Remote roles in:
- Research Engineering / Applied ML Engineering
- Quant / Systems / Tooling Engineering
- Reproducibility / Evaluation / Safety tooling

## Core strengths
- Python automation & tooling
- Experiment discipline (controls, ablations, blinding)
- Deterministic hashing / audit trails
- Fast prototyping across domains
